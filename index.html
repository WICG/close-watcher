<h1>Close signals and close watchers are moving to the HTML Standard!</h1>

<p>The best specification for close signals, close watchers, and the <code>CloseWatcher</code> API currently lives as a draft pull request against the HTML Standard: <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9462">whatwg/html#9462</a>. You can also view a <a href="https://whatpr.org/html/9462/interaction.html#close-signals-and-close-watchers">PR preview</a>. Compared to previous versions that lived at this URL, a few bugs were fixed, and several monkeypatches were moved to the appropriate location.</p>

<p>Once that PR is merged, this URL will redirect to the final specification.</p>
